# File_Protection
A simple way to change permissions on a file or directory in Linux. I made this as part of completing the Udemy course "The Complete C Developer". The original project was a DOS specific program that requires the Borland C++ Turbo Compiler. For this, I changed the code completely, changed the effect of the program, and only used functions that are part of the gcc C compiler.

# What I Learned

*Manipulating systems directly with C

*Updating out of date code
